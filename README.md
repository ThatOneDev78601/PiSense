# PiSense
*MIST 2023 Hackathon Project*

PiSense is a Raspberry Pi-based device designed to help with basic everyday tasks, like checking the temperature, air pressure, and humidity outside, as well as providing useful features like a flashlight.

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi to provide people in rural areas with basic needs such as temperature, air pressure and humidity readings, as well as providing a flashlight for illumination. By providing these essential services, this device helps those living in remote locations access the same resources that are available to those who live in more developed urban areas.

Currently I am unable to calculate the cost for production for my device, due to chip shortages, for example a raspberry pi 4b is costing around $80, which is very unreasonable. If development for this device was to continue then releasing this on the market would require raspberry pi prices to first drop.
